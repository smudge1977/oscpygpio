# oscpygpio

Control the GPIO pins of a RPI (Raspbery PI) with OSC commands
You could use any OSC source device but this is designed to work with the great [companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion) software.

There is a wrapper script to run the actual Python code although this is not really finished

the Python code also has #* comments noting places that need further work...

However it is verison 1.0!

## Big thing that needs doing

The first thing to fix is JIT loading responses in the read_gpio function from the config file!
